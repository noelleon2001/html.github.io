## HTML Learning Progress

**Started 25th March**  
_Lately I have been interested in web programming, 
so I started to learn html5 and css to enhance my skills in this area_  
<br/>
## Why?
As I was wondering through the uses and functions of Github,  
I found out that there is this Github page,  
which is when I thought I can use this to create my own website.  
So I started with:
- Sololearn [my profile](https://www.sololearn.com/Profile/7293505)
- Codecademy
- FreeCodeCamp [my profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/noelleon2001)  
<br/>
Then I tried to apply what I learn in this repositories,  
which I was able learn by doing so.  
Meanwhile, I have also been recreating website as shown in my other repository.  
This helps me to learn how famous websites are created and learn from them.
